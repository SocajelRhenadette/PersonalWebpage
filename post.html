                    <p>Last March 22, 2017, Sean Lew released the video for E to complete his C R E A T E series. E was the most awaited epilogue of the series. Lewsers have been so excited about it. By the time it was released, I must say that it marked an important point in the lives of the Lewsers. For the reason that shown in the video was Sean Lew not only dancing freestyles but also singing his first solo song entitled 4 Walls. Take note: he composed the song.</p>

                    <p> The first time I heard it was like a pause moment to me.  The lyrics were the only ones playing inside my mind. Every single line of the song was striking me. After listening to it, I just wanted to burst out of tears. I don’t know why. Mixed. That is the perfect word to describe my emotions during that time. It may sound like I’m overreacting but I’m pretty sure every fangirl knows how I felt. Finally, C R E A T E has been created. Every letter of the word “create” stands for its own meaning and E is for expand. Sean Lew’s 4 Walls was his way of showing his expansion. Being a popular dancer in Los Angeles, Sean Lew would find singing in a different genre. But he was inspired by the word “expand”. He did not limit himself to what he is good at only.</p>

                    <p>The chorus part of 4 Walls says, “Until you tear down all four walls. Like they were never there at all.” So if there is anything stopping you from expanding, isolating you like you are inside a box, tear down those four walls. Because you are growing. And part of growth is to expand. Expand everything that you are doing. It is important to live outside the box. Learn from your past and set it in the present. I maybe should be telling all of these to myself too since I think I really need this. I have been talking a lot about Sean Lew in my blog. One of the reasons is mainly because of fangirling. Now this would be another Sean Lew blog post. But not for the same reason anymore. I’m having this post because I wanted to pour out my thoughts on something I can relate so much.</p>

                    <center> <p> <i> Keep creating. </i> </center>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">George Orwell’s Animal Farm: An Eye-opener (Reflective Essay)	</h2>

                    <p>George Orwell’s Animal Farm was new to me in some ways. I have not read such allegorical story before. The only fact I know about allegories is that it can be in the form of a story or poem that reveals a hidden moral. But what I like about the story is how George Orwell explored a strong theme to expose the reality.</p>

                    <p>“All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than the others.” This is a line in the story where I found a very significant point. Looking at the world today, it is so ironic that we humans start bearing the same animal attributes in the story. I have seen the reality now about the political schemes, the manipulative conspiracies and the absolute disregard with which the “lower-classes” are oppressed causing the rich to grow richer and the poor to grow poorer. This is a problem most of the countries in the world has faced, and still facing. It is also important to point out how every society despite being promised of equality to all, perish to core human vices, like how “equality” turned to classifications of social classes.</p>

                   

                    <p>All in all, I enjoyed Orwell’s clever analogies to portray our societal cultures in the light of simple farm animals. I particularly liked the donkey, Benjamin, who appears to be stereotypically stubborn and crotchety but intelligent. George Orwell’s Animal Farm makes its readers easily understand the world and the reality of human nature more clearly from its story.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Lewser</h2>

                    <p>Lewser. After becoming one, I didn’t feel like a “loser” although it sounded like it. Lewser is the fandom of Sean Lew stans. Sean Lew is a well-known dancer in Los Angeles, California. Aside from being a dancer, he is also a chef, singer, actor and a choreographer. So with all the talents he obtained, who would not admire him? Well, maybe it is easy for me to say it since he is a dancer and I am also fond of dancing. But the reason why I admire him is not only limited to that.</p>

                   
                      <center>  <img class="img-responsive" src="img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt=""></center>
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Sean Lew in freestyle.</span>

                    <p>Sean Lew inspires me. He once said: “It’s what you do in the dark that puts you in the light.” Those words made me realize that if you believe you have the talent, never think twice on showing it. His positive personality encourages me to keep on doing what I like and keep on liking what I do. And now, it has been a year since the day I became a Lewser. In just a year, I have discovered so many things about myself. I have also made new friends because of Sean Lew.</p>

                    <p>But do you know what is the greatest thing I got from being a Lewser? Sean Lew taught me to stop focusing on how stressed my life is and to always remember how blessed I am.</p>

					 <h2 class="section-heading">tug of war	</h2>
					 <p>we were young

<br/>we were bold

<br/>and we knew

<br/>it has started

<br/>so we grabbed the rope

<br/>and held it so tight

<br/>there is so much in me

<br/>who wants victory

<br/>who wants to pull harder

<br/>until it’s finally you and me

<br/>but i feel smarting pain in my hands

<br/>as it never stop holding on

<br/>even though the sight i see

<br/>in the other end, it isn’t me

<br/>and yet i didn’t release my hold

<br/>towing it to me again

<br/>hoping the hard luck

<br/>will come to a reverse

<br/>until i sensed a prickle in my hand

<br/>down to my heart and it struck me

<br/>the pain is from this grip

<br/>and maybe it’s time to let go of the rope

<br/>the rope i was trying to hold on

<br/>	``and the rope you’ve dropped long ago
